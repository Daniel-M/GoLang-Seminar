# GoLang-Seminar
Repository for the seminar on self-taught Go programming language. We hope to learn a lot about Go (and collaborative work on git) on the process


## Proposed workflow

### First things first 

* If you aren't familiar with the work flow with git, read a fast course like [this one](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/), the
[2 hrs course by codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git), or [the 1hr course by udemy](https://www.udemy.com/git-going-fast/).  
* The folder *resources* contains free books and example codes taken from public sources on the web.  
* Read the materials, feel free to add materials, source code, and all you think that can be of some use.  
* Keep in mind that having a neat presentation for the resources is important (file names, proper folder names, correct branches).  
* You can either create a folder with your name or create a branch with your name to begin working (is up to you).   

### The learning curve on Go

* Go to [project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) **register and save the key to recover the account** (since there is no mail recovery option and you can lose your progress).  
* Pick a problem you think you can solve in Go, create a folder with your name (or a branch) and then a folder with the *ID* of the problem to be solved.
* Solve the problem and commit your changes to the corresponding branch (if you used one).  
* Is recommended to add a simple README.md inside each folder, telling what the problem is about and giving details on your solution [Here is a fast course on Markdown syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) using the *Github* flavored Markdown.  

### Advanced topics that can be addressed

* Incorporate `Makefiles` to your projects.  
* Incorporate `cmake` build system to your projects (more advanced and actually more useful than `make`).  
* Install syntax highlighting for Go on your preferred text editor (I know `vim` has plugins for this).
